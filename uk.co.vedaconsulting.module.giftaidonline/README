-------------------------------------------
v1.5.2
-------------------------------------------
Introduced two new hooks

giftAidOnlineSubmitted( $batchID )
Used if you want to perform an action following successful submission i.e. update another table, send an email etc

invalidGiftAidOnlineContribution( $batchID, $contributionIDRemoved )
Used when contributions aren't submitted due to not meeting gift aid online rules i.e. invalid postcode formats or address lines etc

Also added a new column to the civicrm_gift_aid_submission table
Suggest if your upgrading you add this in manually

ALTER TABLE `civicrm_gift_aid_submission` ADD COLUMN `IRMark` varchar(255);

This column will hold the IR Mark of successfully submitted claims

There is also a new table that holds contributions that were classed as invalid pre-submission and this also needs to be created if your upgrading

The script is in scripts/sql/civi_gift_aid_rejected_contributions
